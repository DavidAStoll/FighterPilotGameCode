# FighterPilotGameCode
Code for Android game project

Contains all the cpp code used for the Android game Fighter Pilot: The Pacific War (See https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fighterPilot.ThePacificWar for more info)

The project uses third party library called FreeType in order to read ttf fonts and the Android NDK to run and build C++ Android, thus the cpp files. Most of the project is in C++, the Java wrapper files are currently missing and will be added later.
